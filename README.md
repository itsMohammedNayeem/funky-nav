# React Router Example

This project demonstrates the basic usage of React Router in a React application.

## Components

- `Home`: The homepage of the application.
- `About`: A page that provides information about the application.
- `Blog`: A blog page with articles or posts.

## Routing

The application uses `react-router-dom` to manage navigation:

- `/` routes to the `Home` component.
- `/about` routes to the `About` component.
- `/blog` routes to the `Blog` component.

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The navigation bar is styled to be sticky and uses complex selectors to style active links with pseudo-elements.

## Usage

To start the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the development server:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
npm start
```
